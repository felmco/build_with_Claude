# 3.5 Thinking Use Cases

## When to use Extended Thinking?

1. **Complex Math & Logic:** "Solve this riddle." "Calculate the trajectory..."
2. **Coding:** "Refactor this legacy codebase." (Thinking allows planning the structure first).
3. **Creative Writing:** "Write a mystery novel outline." (Planning characters and plot twists).
4. **Safety & Policy:** "Analyze if this content violates our complex TOS."

## When NOT to use it?
- Simple greetings ("Hi").
- Fact retrieval ("Capital of France").
- Low-latency applications (Chatbots for simple queries).

## Budgeting
- **Small (1k tokens):** Quick checks.
- **Medium (4k-8k):** Standard coding tasks.
- **Large (16k+):** Deep research, novel writing.
